# Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB Backend with JWT Authentication and Authorization

![Project Logo](https://your-image-url.com)

This repository contains the backend implementation for a Node.js application built with Express.js and MongoDB. The backend provides JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication and authorization mechanisms, along with protected routes to secure access to specific resources. The server exposes RESTful API endpoints to interact with the application.
